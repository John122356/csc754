											<h2>Description</h2>
										</header>
										<p>Benchmarks are an important aspect of computer science and artificial intelligence(AI). They provide a way to empirically test and compare different models.
											In AI, however, simple static benchmarks can be gamed or suffer from the nature of having thousands of researchers try models only for some models to perform well by chance.
											Additionally, it can be argued that simple benchmarks do not test general intelligence as Francois Chollet argues in the paper "On the Measure of Intelligence".
										</p>
										<p>For my paper I plan on writing a survey of Ai benchmarks that use modeling and simulation, because I think they must offer a way to address these problems.
											Dynamical benchmarks created by simulations are likely harder to game, while logic can be included in the benchmarks's model in order to test an AI model's capacity for reasoning logically.

											Their framework is more general than only using the ABIDES simulator and can be used with any discrete event multi-agent simulator.
											They also introduce two financial market simulation environments to be used at reinforcement learning benchmarks.</p>

										<p>This paper advocates for using task as opposed to question and answering to evaluate LLM agents.
											This is to avoid common pitfalls of other LLM benchmarks such as data contamination and benchmark hacking.
											It provides an infrastructure for creating tasks for an LLM agent to perform in a simulated town.

											It produces near photo realistic scenes through procedural generation with objects that can be interacted with.
											The Unity game engine provides a background that can return events based on the agent's actions.
											AI2-THOR seems to be a very popular framework for training and evaluating agent based AI.

											This is to help developers experiment with different methods before investing in real human feedback.
											Since the simulations are replicable, different learning algorithms can be compared and several are tested in this paper.

											Although it may not be appropriate for this survey paper, I think the ARC-AGI benchmark outlines why it's important to have more dynamical benchmarks for artificial intelligence.

										<p>This paper is not about modeling and simulation, but provides a framework for evaluating benchmarks.
											Two issues it mentions that I think simulation based benchmarks can address are benchmark saturation and data contamination.
											Benchmark saturation is when the an AI model can perform nearly as well as is possible, and data contamination is when the data a model is trained on makes it into the test data.
											Complicated tasks in simulations that require planning and logic as well dynamically created environments can help address these issues.
